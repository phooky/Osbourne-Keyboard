0.125uS is 2 cycles on an atmega core.
HOWEVER-- that's "minimum" dot time.
total time is 52uS-- 416 pixels.
with some sort of sync'd multiplexer, we could get higher
speeds... pushing our 2 or 4 pixels at a time. how to sync
it, though?

initial hackery: atmega

sophisticated hackery: beaglebone or the like
